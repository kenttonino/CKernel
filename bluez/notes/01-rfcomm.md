# Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM)

> - A bluetooth protol that emulates serial ports over Bluetooth.
> - It pretends a Bluetooth connection in a serial cable.
> - If you have two devices, like a laptop and a headset, RFCOMM lets them talk as if they where connected physical serial port, even though its wireless.
> - RFCOMM exists to trick old software and devices into thinking there's a cable, so everything works over wireless without rewriting decades of code.
